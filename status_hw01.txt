4. What's the URL of your Github repository for this assignment?

https://github.com/kylesmith-1/webdev-hw01

5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?

I found it mostly straighforward. I had a small amount of trouble
getting the hw01 nginx file working, as I had copied from the example,
and that did not exactly correlate with the "/main" directory I used.
This was very minor though. I was also confused about pointing my
domain at the VPS, as I was just trying to use URL forwarding,
rather than A Records. On NameCheap this required me to use 
http://[IP of VPS], which was not working for SSH at least.
